### Problem
The main problem with this dataset is to analyse and predict the count of the bikes shared. It is essential to perform prediction on the count of bikes shared as it could help to identify the trend and behaviour patterns in the bike-sharing system. By forecasting the outcome on the count of bikes shared, we can gain more insights that can lead to a more effective business and a better investment decision. As there are many parameters such as temperature, humidity, time and others that influence the count of bike shared, we can analyse the correlation between the parameters with the count of bike shared and develop some models to predict the prediction of the count of bike shared.

### Solution
This project contains two parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization<br>
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach in analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. It is used to derive useful information / knowledge / pattern from raw data.

2. Development of Data Mining Models
Develop effective models to predict the count of bikes shared.<br>
To perform the classification algorithm on the dataset, we convert the count of bikes shared into 2 bins, which are lower than average and higher than average.<br>
The models that will be used in this project are as follows:

#### Classification Models
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. DecisionTree Classifier

#### Clustering Models
1. KMeans
2. Gaussian Mixture
  
## Tools
1. Anaconda distribution package
2. Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
Import the files into your project.<br>
Run the project with Juypter Notebook.

## Test
No test has been performed.
